		        		One problem encountered when making this program was that one of the if functions would call the same function no matter what the user would input.
		        		This was fixed by fixing some of the syntax of the if function.
		        		Another problem that was encountered was the user being able to enter an option that was not given.
		        		This was solved by using an if/elif/else statement anything that was entered would run the else function.
		        		One thing that was done independently was setting up the if/elif/else statements.

						Your boat has crashed and you ended up on what seems to be a deserted island. 
						You head into the forest and begin to look around. 
						After a while of looking you find some berries. 
						You decided to not eat the berries and continue exploring. 
						You hear a scream and you decide to go check it out.
						You find a person being attacked by a pack of lemurs.
						You decide to help the person.
						You pick up the closest stick you can find and charge the lemurs.
						The lemurs turn to attack you and the person runs off.
						You spend about five minutes trying to get away from the lemurs but they won't stop. 
						You decide that continuing to fight would be the best option. 
						After a while you get too tired to fight back and the lemurs start tearing into you.
