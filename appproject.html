		        		After being on the main screen for half of a second a notifier pops up saying
		        		“Find out if you are a true AMERICAN!”. Pressing the start button starts the game and
		        		pressing the about button takes the user to the about screen. When playing the game answering
		        		a question correct cause the button selected to turn green and play a bell sound.  
		        		Answering a question wrong causes the button selected to turn red and play a buzzer sound. 
		        		After answering all the questions the game will tell the user how many they got right out 
		        		of the total amount of questions and give them the option to go to the main screen or the 
		        		about screen. On the about screen it list the creators of the app and after being on the screen 
		        		for one second a notifier pops up saying “BOOOO!!!!”.</p>

		        	<p class="p-text">One difficulty encountered in making this app was getting the question and the user choices corresponding to the question to appear at the same time. At the start of the app this was not a problem but when the user kept playing the app some of the user choices from different questions would reappear or not correspond to the question being asked. This problem was solved by removing the user choice after it has been used.
	Another difficulty that was encountered was getting the all of the user choices to appear on a random button. Some of the user choices would would not appear on the buttons leaving some of them blank. Making a for each item in list instead of making separate code for each choice fixed this problem.
	One thing in the code that I did independently was checking to see if the answer was right or wrong. This was done by comparing the user's choice to a list of answers stored in the code.
